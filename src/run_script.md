# Starting the Visualizer

The Visualizer can be run by finding the folder which was downloaded in the installation process, and then launching the "RUN.bat" file. If any parts of the installation are missing, the prompt will notify you. 

If the Visualizer is correctly installed, you should see a window open in your web browser that shows an empty graph. This means the Visualizer is ready but has no data loaded yet.
