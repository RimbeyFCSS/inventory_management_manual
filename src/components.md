# Components of the Program

The program mainly consists of 3 parts; a Microsoft Form, an Excel sheet hosted on Sharepoint, and a Python script (the Visualizer) to be run locally on a computer. 

The form and Excel sheet are linked together, and so any information submitted via the form will appear in the sheet. The sheet must be available locally on the computer for the Visualizer to read it, and so the recommended approach is to "sync" the RFCSS Sharepoint to your computer, which will make files on Sharepoint available on your computer.
