# For Maintenance

It has been noted in the Project Agreement that this program is likely not worth fixing, should it ever break. However, this section provides advice in case something breaks, so that one may fix it without needing to hire an external developer.

There are 2 main areas where this program may break:

1. The interconnection between the components. The most likely area for problems.
2. Deprecations in the Visualizer.
