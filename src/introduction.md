# Introduction

The Inventory Management program is a 3-part service which allows the users to easily submit a count of their inventory, and then visualize historical trends via a graph.

This manual explains how to install the program onto your computer, how to interact with it, and how all the components work.

Additionally, there are resources available for reaching out to developers if something breaks and you wish to fix the program.
