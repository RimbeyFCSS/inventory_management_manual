# Submitting - Microsoft Form
After counting the current inventory you have, you can submit it using the Microsoft Form associated with this program, which can be accessed [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=m_AL35yEIk6iVOkCdO7vFSTnB8gaQdJHrLKoIEbpIGxUODlaMEJCTVFVTFpDRENFQTNHTDdZTUMwUiQlQCN0PWcu). Make sure you are signed into your RFCSS account to access it.

Every time you submit a new form, a row on data will appear in the sheet. Each row should correspond to a unique date, and so please avoid submitting multiple forms in one day. If multiple forms are submitted in a day, you will need to eliminate all but one in the sheet.

## About modifying the Form
The form is connected to the Excel sheet, and so if you ever decide to modify the contents of the form, be sure to run tests and make sure that the sheet still functions normally. 

Make sure that the inputted counts for all inventory are numbers (0, 1, 2...) that do not contain decimal points, alphabetic characters, or other invalid inputs. This will cause the program to stop working. Microsoft Forms can be configured to restrict inputs to only a certain type, so make sure to do so.
