## Required Qualifications
You will be looking for a developer who has experience with the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/), as well as the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) libraries for Python.

Knowing Python is a **requirement**, while Pandas and Plotly are *strongly recommended* (since if they aren't familiar with the libraries, it will take them longer to fix it, and possibly lead to more errors).
