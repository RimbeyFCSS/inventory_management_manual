# Loading data

The Visualizer purely serves as a high-tech "window" into your Excel sheet, and so it itself does not create, modify, or otherwise contain data. Thus, any interactions you have with the Visualizer will *not* affect the data it is visualizing.

Data can be loaded by clicking the button at the top of the window, and then selecting the Excel sheet that corresponds to the form.

*The location or name of the Excel sheet will not affect the program. The following are the only requirements for the sheet to be correctly loaded:*

- the sheet is available locally (or "offline") on your computer 
- the sheet is structured where there is a column *exactly* named "Enter Date", which contains dates
- the other columns in the sheet contain *numbers only*.
